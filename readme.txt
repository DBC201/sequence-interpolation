This program predicts the next element of a given sequence of numbers.

How the Program Works

An example sequence: 3 9 27 81

The sequence is divided into two layers that represent addition and multiplication

First addition layer: 6, 18, 54
First multiplication layer: 3, 3, 3

Second addition layer that derives from first addition: 12, 36
Second Multiplication layer that derives from first addition: 3, 3

Third addition layer deriving from second addition that dv from first addition: 24
Third multiplication layer deriving from second addition that dv from first addition: 3

If all the elements are the same(and there is more than one element) 
there is no need to calculate bottom layers because constant change has been reached and the
next rate of change must be the same.

If only one element is left, a sequence can be based upon that element assuming it
as the next rate of change.

This was a result of a thought I had 2 years ago, and I have come up with this purely on my own. Deniz Cakiroglu 7/21/2020
